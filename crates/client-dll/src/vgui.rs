//! The client's VGUI2 interface for Steam GoldSrc: the `ClientFactory` and `CreateInterface`
//! exports and an `IClientVGUI` ("VClientVGUI001") object whose `UseVGUI1()` returns false.
//!
//! Steam's engine has two ways to draw the 3D view. If the client exposes no `IClientVGUI`, it
//! treats the client as a VGUI1 client: while the game UI is hidden it paints only the VGUI1 root
//! panel, and the client's VGUI1 viewport is expected to call `VGui_ViewportPaintBackground` from
//! its `paintBackground` (TS 3.0's viewport does, `0x1005b3c0`, as does the SDK's
//! `TeamFortressViewport`). The engine draws the world and calls `HUD_Redraw` from there. This port
//! has no VGUI1 viewport (that is C++ ABI), so without this interface nothing draws the world on
//! Steam: the screen stays black with the last loading dialog on it (issue #62). With
//! `UseVGUI1() == false` the engine paints the viewport background itself every frame, as it does
//! for Counter-Strike's VGUI2 client.
//!
//! A VGUI1 client also gets `IN_DeactivateMouse`/`IN_ActivateMouse` whenever the game UI takes or
//! releases input; a VGUI2 client doesn't, and is told through `HideClientUI`/`ActivateClientUI`
//! instead, so those two forward to the same mouse calls.
//!
//! The engine only looks for `VClientVGUI001` when the client also exports `ClientFactory` (the
//! `cldll_func_t` slot after `HUD_GetPlayerTeam`). FWGS calls neither export and draws the world
//! itself, so this changes nothing there.
//!
//! `IClientVGUI` is a C++ interface, so the object is a vtable pointer laid out by hand: the
//! Itanium ABI (Linux) has two destructor slots and passes `this` as the first argument; MSVC has
//! one (the scalar deleting destructor) and uses `thiscall` on 32-bit x86. The engine never
//! deletes the object, which is a static.
